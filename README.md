# AirfoilShape_PolynomialRegression
The aim of this project was to develop a code that could provide the best polynomial fit of a degree specified for the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil. The user needs only to upload the .dat file (UIUC,airfoiltools etc) and provide the degree of polynomial.
